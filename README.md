<p>
DNS servers are used to provide a numerous number of ways to map names of websites to the IP addresses
(numbers). The way its supposed to be looked at is, picture a miniature phone book, which had all the numbers in
today’s world; it’s the exact same for the internet, although the names are linked to these numbers. The DNS’s
responsibility is to find the correct IP address (number) for what you might be looking for.
I also implemented print requests on both ends (client / server) to display messages to indicate that the server is
running, and every time a request is made; it reflects on the server with a query. I was also able to implement a while
loop to check if the client would want to make a continuous action of asking thew server for more DNS resolutions.
